# ctimer
ctimer is an amateur project in C I made for fun. The code is far from perfect, but it does what it needs to do I guess. It all runs in the terminal.



## Linux/Windows Support
While Linux and Windows are supported, most Unix-Based kernels should be able to run it too.

## Guide
### <ins>Commands</ins>
- Type ```ctimer``` in your terminal to run it.
- Adding ```stopwatch```` or ```countdown``` is a quicker way to start the timer.

# Changelog
## v1.0.1 (08/03/2025)
- Added support for command-line arguments (stopwatch and countdown).

## Future Ideas
- Timer Styles
- Multithreading for input
- argc and argv implementation for faster access
- Multiple Timers
- I'll probably think of more here at some point

# ctimer
ctimer is an amateur project in C I made for fun. The code is far from perfect, but it does what it needs to do I guess. It all runs in the terminal.

## Linux/Windows Support
While Linux and Windows are supported, most Unix-Based kernels should be able to run it too.

## Future Ideas
- Timer Styles
- Multithreading for input
- argc and argv implementation for faster access
- Multiple Timers
- I'll probably think of more here at some point

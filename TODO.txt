General Idea:

The timer will have a menu that will
let you select the time of timer you want.
You can have countdown mode, or a stopwatch mode.
Ideally you would want the timers to run in the background,
or maybe even run multiple timers. Ideally
a simple neat UI would suffice.

Things to implement:

- Dynamic UI structure
- Multiple Timers running at the same time
- Ease of use
- Eventual portability

WHERE I LEFT OFF:
- Properly fix the state and mode system.
